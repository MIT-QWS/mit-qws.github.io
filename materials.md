# Course Materials

## Day 1: Superposition
### What is quantum computing and why are we pursuing it? Today, we introduce the field and its history. Moreover, we begin to define a qubit both mathematically and physically, modulo interference. Lecturers: Ági Villányi and Matt Yeh. ([notes](/superposition-notes-2026.pdf))([lecture video](https://mit.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f5d88781-fa92-4b6c-89e2-b3d70120c0c5))

## Day 2: Interference
### What is interference and why can it be used for quantum advantage? Today we will go over the Bloch sphere, and learn how to apply to the tensor product. We will also cover physical implementations of the CNOT gate. Lecturers: Matt Yeh, Ági Villányi. ([notes](/day2-interference-2026.pdf))

## Day 3: Entanglement
### What is entanglement and how can we harness it for computation? Lecturers: Ági Villányi.

## Day 4: Algorithms and Applications
### What will we use quantum computers for once they exist? Today, we go through Shor's algorithm and the basics of quantum simulation. Lecturers: Ági Villányi, Cora Barrett.
